Now, I want to build the other module of my app store - product reviews system. I am providing database models and api schema for that , provide me working code according to that .  Important Instructions -> 
1. FastAPI server 
2. Postgresql as database
3. Peewee as ORM
4. Adhere to SOLID Design principles, and have clear separation of concerns between api , db and service layers
5. Assume request and response in -accordance with other api's structure for the missing one's.



Database Schema
Class User:
id: UUID
name: varchar
email : varchar
profile: s3-url-image

Class Review:
  id: UUID
  product_id: FK ( references to product )
  user_id: FK ( reference to user )
  rating: int  (1 -5 )
  description: Text ( VARCHAR- 255)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
  status: Inactive / active


Class Comments:
  id: UUID
  review_id: str FK ( references to Review )
  description: str
  user_id: str 

Class ReviewMetrics:
Id: UUID
review_id: FK ( references to Review )
upvotes: int
downvotes: int
comments: int

Can you please use liquibase migrations for creating tables and have an easy setup file for starting database in a  
docker container , running migrations and inserting only dummy users data in it. 
----


----
I am using uv for Dependencies. 
Modify setup and associated readme files accordingly. ( create venv using uv, installing dependencies and so on )
----

----
Great, now do the following changes ->
1. Remove unused files like setup_db.py
2. Modify migration to make product_id column in reviews as string only
3. Don't directly call peewee models in service layer.  Instead extract the db interacttions to a dao layer ( which uses those db model as dependecy ) and then inject this dao layer in service layer. 
4. Product_id actually referes to the id column of productInDB document in my mongodb database. Ensure it's existence when receiving add review request
----

----
Unexpected error running Liquibase: /liquibase/liquibase.properties. Getting this when running the setup script
----

----
Getting permission error when liquibase trying to access changelog file inside container which is mounted to my local directory.
I have relevant permissions and i am using fedora as OS
----

----
Update / Delete review api's don't need to have user_id field as we have review_id (unique) as path param already
----


-----
Whenever a review is added / updated / deleted for a product successfully , update the product's avg rating in MongoDb DATABASE  
( Use events for it instead of directly invoking a function in homepage module so that
 it can be extracted out as a separate process later on 
 )
-----

----
I have restructured the project a bit to set proper hieracrchy , separation of concerns , dependency injection for reviews router,
db model and service files. Follow the same process and restructure project accordingly
----

---
Great, now do the following things ->
1. Update Get product review metrics api to return avg rating and total reviews also i.e use get_review_summary_stats function in the metrics service
2. Remove unused functions in all the files  including service and dao layer
---


----
Can you please add unit test cases for service files in  homepage module ?. Important instructions to follow :- 
1. Ensure 100 % code coverage for the files being tested
2. U can safely mock database and any third party calls
3. Add required dependency like if using pytest in pyrpoject.toml file and add command to run tests with writing covergae report to html in readme file
----

----
These test cases are failing, becuase user_id should be an UUID and not some random string
