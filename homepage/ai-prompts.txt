I am building some parts of an  apple appstore like system
- homepage and review-n ratings for the product.
I am starting with the homepage module for which i should have basic api's like add product, list products , search for a product. 
Can you setup my homepage module for that ? Requirements :-
1. MongoDb for storing product details
2. Elastic Search for supporting search capabilities
3. FastAPI server with api implementations ( no authentication required ) for the admin Api - Add product and List Product and Search for a product

to ensure smooth working
