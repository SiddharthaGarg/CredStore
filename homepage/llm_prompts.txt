I am building some parts of an  apple appstore like system
- homepage and review-n ratings for the product.
I am starting with the homepage module for which i should have basic api's like add product, list products , search for a product. 
Can you setup my homepage module for that ? Requirements :-
1. MongoDb for storing product details
2. Elastic Search for supporting search capabilities
3. FastAPI server with api implementations ( no authentication required ) for the admin Api - Add product and List Product and Search for a product 

----

I am using uv for dependencies. Getting elastic search connection issue while starting server. Fix that and do some api calls 
to ensure smooth working
----


----
Explain this search_products function.
----

----
What should flow look like when API request comes for adding a product i.e ideal way to use elastic search and mongoDb together ?
----

----
Okay, Now following similar project structure for product_reviews module ( proper separation of concern , classes and dependency injection for api, db and service layerr) , restructure my homepage module. 
Restructuring shouldn't affect core functionality and business logics

Can you please add unit test cases for service files in  homepage module ?. Important instructions to follow :- 
1. Ensure 100 % code coverage for the files being tested
2. U can safely mock database and any third party calls
3. Add required dependency like if using pytest in pyrpoject.toml file and add command to run tests with writing covergae report to html in readme file
